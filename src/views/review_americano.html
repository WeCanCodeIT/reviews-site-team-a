                <h2>Espresso and Water, equal parts</h2>
                <p>Elegance combined with simplicity. This beverage is meant to be sweetened heavily, if you are
                    European. However, as an American, I enjoy the bitterness this small drink provides. Most locations
                    I frequent know how I take my coffee (small Americano, quad, and top it off with water). As I travelled
                    some European cities, I had to learn how <i>they</i> take their coffee. Similar to mine, but with a
                    lot more sugar!
